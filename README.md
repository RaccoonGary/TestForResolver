Hi there!

This repo contains test code based on Selenium framework to complete the objectives outlined in Resolver's Test Task

I (Jinu) have used java to code using Selenium framework. I have used Maven to build the project and TestNG to manage the Test execution.
I have used POM with PageFactory to create a page class. I have also used ExpertReport plugin to see the test execution result report.

Please follow the following steps to run the Test:

1. Clone this repository into you local machine using: git clone "https://github.com/RaccoonGary/TestForResolver.git"
2. Then open the project on Intellij/Eclipse (I have used Intellij)
3. Once the project is open, please build once
4. Right click on "testng.xml" to Run the Testcases
5. As per current setup, all test cases with execute on parallel on 6 instances of chrome web browser
6. Once, test is complete, please right click on "ExtentReportResults.html" and click on Copy Path to copy the path
7. Open above path on any browser to see the Test Report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
